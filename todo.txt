* TODO work on stuff in todo.txt
* (Text-based) UI for arbitrary EPlayerIndex (useful to test behaviour with more than one CPlayerHuman)
* Implement Bettel
* Implement Hochzeit
* AI suspicion debugging facility: Export suspicion tree to expandable/collapsible HTML page
* Maybe something like payout_hint is useful to prune suspicion tree
* Move tests into own files/modules
* implement more rules
* split CStich into CStichComplete and CStichCurrent
* "graphical" output (possibly via libaa/libcaca/termimage) (possibly by augmenting/impriving ask_for_alternative)
* simplify count_runnings: consider only highest trumpf per party
* &Box<X> => &X
* fix graphical output (currently, it is often cleared when ai is running)
* add indication to show that ai is working
* clean up mess introduced by SAiCheating-Commit
* compute_successors should acknowledge ostich_given
* could susp_from_raw construct m_ahand on its own (to ensure ahand.iter().transform(hand.size()).all_same)
* should rules/mod.rs reexport all necessary things for concrete rules?
* VTrumpfOrFarbe should not be publicly exported (concept of Trumpf/Farbe should be internal to TRules)
* sort_cards_fist_trumpf_then_farbe should not be needed (concept of Trumpf/Farbe should be internal to TRules)
